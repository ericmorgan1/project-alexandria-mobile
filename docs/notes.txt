NOTES FOR BUILDING / DEVELOPING

*** RUNNING APP IN BROWSER ***
- Use the "Getting Started" guide from the Ionic Framework: https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/
- Run "ionic serve" from a command line in the ionic directory

*** BUILDING APP FOR IPHONE ***
- It only works on a Mac and you need to have XCode installed.
- Then, run these commands:
	- cordova platform add ios
	- ionic resources
	- ionic build ios
- Open the "platforms/ios/xxx.xcodeproj" file
- Take care of any XCode errors (sometimes you have to sign in with your developer ID, sometimes you have to update some libraries)
- Run the project from XCode (you can use an emulator or your actual device)	
- More details: http://docs.usecreator.com/docs/export-a-native-ipa-for-apple

*** BUILDING APP FOR ANDROID ***
<I haven't done this yet, so not confident on it>

*** NOTES ON FILES/DIRECTORIES ***

All the important files for development are in the /www directory.
I don't use the /scss directory, but if you wanted, you could compile files from that directory into CSS.

/resources/icon.png				When you run "ionic resources", this will be used to create icons of various sizes
/resources/splash.png 			When you run "ionic resources", this will be used to create splash screens of various sizes

/www/css/* 						Contains all the CSS styles for the app.
/www/css/ionic.app.css	 		Default styles for an Ionic app. (Don't recommend modifying this).
/www/css/custom.css				Contains custom styles and overrides for the app.

/img/*							Contains images used by the app.

/js/*							Contains JS scripts used by the app
/js/app.js						Auto-generated file that does some configuration.
/js/controllers.js 				AngularJS controllers (handle logic of the pages)
/js/directives.js 				AngularJS directives (reusable components)
/js/routes.js 					Handles UI routing
/js/services.js					AngularJS services (for accessing data like the API)

/lib/* 							Files used by Ionic framework

/templates/* 					HTML markup for the individual pages
