projectalexandria.net API "documentation"

All endpoints are currently under projectalexandria.net/api/v1/

/search?title=&author=
        Search for books by title and/or author.
Output:
        {'response': [
                {'title': Book title,
                'author': Book author(s),
                'id':     UUID used to identify a unique book},
                ... ]}

        The 'id' field is what you'll be using to access more information about each book. The
        length of the list of results is currently 20, but that could change.

/books/:id
        Get information about a single book.
Output:
        {'id':         Same ID that was submitted,
        'title':       Book title,
        'author':      Book author(s),
        'isbn':        Book ISBN,
        'description': Brief description of book (no explicit wordlimit, though they're generally
                100-400 words); may contain HTML/character entities. Description may contain
                information about the physical book along with story information.}

        'id', 'title', and 'author' should match what you saw in the search results. We do not
        expose any sort of API to get the book cover, but you can use the Zola Books API along
        with the 'isbn' field to get a book cover image like so: api.zo.la/v4/image/display?id=:isbn&w=
        where w indicates the image width you'd like.

/books/:id/neighbors
        Get information about a book's most similar "neighbors".
Output:
        {'response: [
                {'id':    UUID used to identify a unique book,
                'title':  Neighbor book title,
                'author': Neighbor book author(s),
                'similarity_reasons': [ ... ]
                        List of enum-style strings detailing the way in which the neighbor
                        is similar, with the most significant reason first.
                        Possible values: 'topics', 'expert_opinions', 'authors', 'descriptions',
                        'word_choice'
                }, ...]}

        Currently, 5 neighbors are returned, though that may be tunable in the future.
